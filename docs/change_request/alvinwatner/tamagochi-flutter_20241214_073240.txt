Specific Changes:
- Fix game initialization sequence:
  * Add loading state indicator during pet creation
  * Verify navigation flow from start button to pet screen
  * Ensure proper state initialization before screen transition
- Update start game handling:
  * Add error boundary around initial game state
  * Implement fallback display for failed state loading
  * Add retry mechanism for failed initialization
- Enhance state management:
  * Validate pet data structure on game start
  * Ensure proper default values for new pet creation
  * Add state verification before screen rendering

Constraints:
- Maintain existing save game compatibility
- Keep initial loading time under 2 seconds
- Support offline functionality
- Preserve user preferences and settings

Expected Output:
A stable game initialization process where clicking the start game button properly loads the pet screen with all required initial states. Users should see either a loading indicator or their pet, never a gray screen. Failed states should show clear error messages with retry options.

Success Criteria:
- Start game button leads to visible pet screen or clear error message
- All pet stats properly initialize for new games
- Saved games load correctly with preserved state
- No gray screens appear during any transition
- Loading states provide visual feedback to users
